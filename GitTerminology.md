**Repository:** (aka repo) is the container for all the files of your project. This will be the Git directory.  
**Stage:** stores information about what will go into your next commit. IS LIKE a unofficial commitment.   
**Commit:** is like “saving” or “storing” your changes to the current state of the project. YOU ARE committing to the project. Each Commit generates a unique hash/key code, for distinguishing and identifying each of the commits.  
**Branch:** a separate path, you diverge from the main path and continue to do work without messing it. The main path is typically called ```master```; this will be the trunk of the tree and the branches are part of, yet not the central component.  
**Merge:** mixes the changes from one branch into another.  
**Fork:** a copy of a repository to your GitHub account. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.  
**Clone:** create a copy a remote repository (e.g. GitHub) to your local system.  
**Pull Request:** you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.  
**Push Request:** command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.  

### NOTE: 

**_Committed_** means that the data is safely stored in your local database.   
**_Modified_** means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.   
**_Staged_** means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.  
The common order would be: Modified>Staged>Committed
